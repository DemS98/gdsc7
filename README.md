## The grade-AI generation. Re-righting Education with data & AI

---

üìñ Hi everyone and welcome to the 7th edition of the Global Data Science Challenge: The grade-AI generation! üìñ

We‚Äôre thrilled to have you join us for this year‚Äôs event where we, the Large Human Models (LHM), team up with our new 
AI pals ‚Äì the Large Language Models (LLM). Sure, we might not have everything in common (they may not need coffee breaks), 
but it‚Äôs amazing how well we can work together, especially when it comes to tackling challenges in education. So get ready 
to flex those prompt engineering muscles and dive into some seriously cool conversations with AI, all while supporting a 
great cause: education!

This year, our focus is on improving the analysis of massive amounts of form data collected from the *Progress in 
International Reading Literacy Study* (PIRLS). Students, parents, and teachers around the world have filled out 
a variety of questionnaires, addressing that timeless cornerstone of education: reading.

Why reading, you ask? Well, because education ‚Äì and especially reading ‚Äì empowers people. It fuels creativity, 
sparks innovation, and opens doors to new opportunities. Plus, it‚Äôs pretty handy when it comes to making sense of the 
world. Reading not only enhances critical thinking but also builds empathy and fosters an understanding of different 
cultures and ideas. Essentially, reading is like a superpower that unites us across borders and helps us thrive in an 
increasingly complex, information-packed world.

In this challenge, you‚Äôll get the chance to team up with LLMs and make the process of digging through heaps of 
questionnaire data more efficient. Your mission? To create an AI agent capable of answering complex questions about 
PIRLS ‚Äì but with a twist: your agent needs to retrieve real data instead of relying on its memory. This won‚Äôt just 
require your prompt engineering 
skills, but also some serious data analysis, database querying, and a solid understanding of LLMs (along with their 
delightful quirks).

As much as this is a competition, remember that it‚Äôs also an opportunity to connect and collaborate with your 
fellow participants. The Global Data Science Challenge is a community of talented minds from around the world, 
all ready to share ideas, learn from each other, and dive deep into the hot new world of LLMs. And hey, let‚Äôs not forget 
to have a little fun while we‚Äôre at it!

So, buckle up buttercup ‚Äì education needs you! The Grade-AI Generation is calling for your creativity, ingenuity, 
and problem-solving prowess. Together, we can make a real difference in the world of education, one line of code 
at a time.

Good luck to you all, and see you on the battlefield! (*menacing foreshadowing*) ‚öîÔ∏è üìñ
